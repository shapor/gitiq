# GitIQ Style Guide

## Core Philosophy: KEEP IT SIMPLE!

## Technology Requirements
- Backend: Python with Flask only
- Frontend: Pure HTML and JavaScript
- No frameworks or libraries except Flask and GitPython
- No build tools, preprocessors, or package managers

## Key Rules
1. No classes or object-oriented programming
2. Pure functions and simple data structures (dicts, lists, tuples)
3. No abstractions unless absolutely necessary
4. Standard library preferred over third-party packages

## Naming and Style
- snake_case for all functions and variables
- UPPER_CASE for constants
- Maximum line length: 88 characters
- Simple, descriptive function names
- Type hints only when they improve clarity

## Forbidden
- Classes and OOP
- Code generation tools
- Build processes
- CSS preprocessors
- State management libraries
- Frontend frameworks
- ORMs
- Template engines except Flask's default
- Component libraries
- Utility libraries
