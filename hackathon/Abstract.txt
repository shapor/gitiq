Today's AI coding assistants force developers into cumbersome workflows that break established software engineering practices. Developers must constantly context-switch between their IDE and chat interfaces, manually copy-paste code snippets, and deal with incomplete responses containing placeholders like "rest of code remains the same." These tools also fail to preserve the provenance of AI-generated code – there's no record of which model or prompt led to specific code changes. Additionally, the lack of integration with code review workflows means teams can't effectively evaluate AI-generated changes using their existing diff-based review processes.

GitIQ reimagines AI pair programming by using Git as the primary interface rather than embedding in an IDE or chat interface. Operating as a lightweight agent that can be invoked within any local Git repository, GitIQ behaves like a real software engineering colleague who makes changes, commits code, and responds to feedback. Instead of generating fragmentary code snippets, GitIQ creates complete Pull Requests with proper commit messages and documentation. Each commit is made under a dedicated gitiq-bot user, maintaining clear attribution and preserving the exact prompt and model that generated each code change.

What sets GitIQ apart is how naturally it integrates into existing development workflows. Just as you would collaborate with a human colleague, GitIQ can iteratively refine code based on PR comments and feedback, polishing changes until they're ready for merge. By operating at the Git level, GitIQ preserves the full context of changes, enabling proper code review workflows with changes presented as coherent diffs that reviewers can evaluate using their standard tools and practices. This approach maintains the rigor of software engineering best practices while making AI assistance feel like a natural extension of the development process.

GitIQ demonstrates its capabilities through self-bootstrapping – much of its own codebase was generated through GitIQ-created Pull Requests. This meta-development approach provides concrete validation of the tool's effectiveness while creating a traceable history of AI-human collaboration. The result is a seamless integration of AI capabilities into the software development lifecycle, where the AI assistant behaves less like a black box code generator and more like a helpful team member who understands Git workflows, responds to feedback, and maintains proper documentation of their contributions.
